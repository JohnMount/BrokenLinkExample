Broken pkgdown link example.

To reproduce.

1) Create new project (this) in RStudio
2) Create this README.Rmd file
3) Edit DESCRIPTION file and .Rbuildignore
3) Create directory and file extras/example.md
4) knit README.Rmd
5) Run pkgdown::build_site() in R.

Observed: this link works in README.md but is broken in docs/index.html.
Expected: link to work both places (i.e. not be re-written from *.md to *.html).
